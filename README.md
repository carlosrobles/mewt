# mewt
Mewt allows you to create a **hardware button to Mute and Unmute all system microphones in Windows and Mac**.  

Mute/unmute occurs at the system level, so this **works for all conferencing software** (Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, WebEx, Blue Jeans, GoToMeeting, Skype, Slack, Facebook, Discord, etc.)

Mewt will **continuously display the current Mute/Unmute state** so you can tell at a glance if your microphone is enabled without having to search for the onscreen icon.

If your microphone is broadcasting, Mewt will also help you **avoid embarassing hot-mike incidents via RDB LED display**.
